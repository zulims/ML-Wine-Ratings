# Explore and Drink Wine

We analzyed over 100,000 wines to build machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict wine quality. First, we used Tableau to learn and understand the data. Then we made two ML models. Choose features of a wine and the model predicts the quality as well as 3 of the best wines that fit your choices. Or, play a wine critic and see how our ML model will rate a wine based on a description you write. Finally, we dug into what we learned about front end development to create an interactive web-app running on heroku that will let you try it for yourself:
