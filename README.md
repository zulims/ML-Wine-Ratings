# Explore and Drink Wine

We analzyed over 100,000 wines to build machine learning (ML) algorithms capable of predicting wine quality. First, we used Tableau to learn and understand the data. Then we made two ML models. The first lets you input various wine characteristics and returns the likely rating as well as 3 of the best wines that fit your criteria. The second lets you play the critic and returns a likely wine rating based soley on your description. Finally, we dug into what we learned about front end development to create an interactive web-app running on heroku that will let you try all this for yourself:
